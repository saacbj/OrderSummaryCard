## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

For this challenge I focused on some properties of CSS such as relative units and the position property for the divs in conjunction with Flexbox.

### Continued development

A very important aspect of this project I'd like to improve in the future is the responsiveness of the layout and especifically the scalability of the svg elements.
